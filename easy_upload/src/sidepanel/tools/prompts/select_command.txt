Among the proposed commands, you must return the number of the one that best matches the user’s intent.

## Example

**Input:**
user intent: “I want to compress the image to reduce its file size”
tool proposals:
0 - I want to set a specific option for the output format (e.g., compression/size limit or metadata) to control the exported file’s characteristics.
1 - I want to compress the image to make its file size smaller without changing its format.
2 - I want to apply a predefined color correction using a CDL file to adjust the image colors.

**Output:**
{ tool_number: 1 }
