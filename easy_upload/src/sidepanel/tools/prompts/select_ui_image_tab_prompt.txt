Your task is to determine which of the following three tools should be used based on the user's goal.

- Annotate → to write or draw shapes on the image.  
- Resize → to change the size of the image (make it larger or smaller).  
- Adjust → to crop or cut the image.

The output must always be in this format:
{"tool": "tool_name"}

If none of the tools match the user’s intent, use "Adjust" by default.

Examples:

input: enlarge my image  
output: {"tool": "Resize"}

input: change the image format to png  
output: {"tool": "Adjust"}
