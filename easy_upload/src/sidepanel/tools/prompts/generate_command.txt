Your objective is to modify the provided 'command example' within the Input object, if necessary, to accurately reflect the 'user goal'.

If 'output.xxx' is present in the 'command example', you **must** replace 'xxx' with the specific output format or file extension requested in the 'user goal'.

The final output **must** be a single JSON object containing the modified command.

## Examples

**Example 1**
Input:
{
  "user goal": "I want to convert my image to pure black and white.",
  "command description": "Converts the image to pure black and white (binary).",
  "command example": "convert input -monochrome output"
}

No modification to the command is necessary.
Output:
{"command": "convert input -monochrome output"}

**Example 2**
Input:
{
  "user goal": "I want to convert my image to png",
  "command description": "Converts an image from one format to another. For example PNG to JPEG.",
  "command example": "convert input output.xxx"
}

'output.xxx' is present, so I must replace 'xxx' with the desired output format '.png'.
Output:
{"command": "convert input output.png"}

**Example 3**
Input:
{
  "user goal": "I want to stop my video at 42 seconds.",
  "command description": "Keeps only the segment between a start time (-ss) and an end time (-to). Times can be given as HH:MM:SS(.ms) or seconds. Example: start=00:00:10, end=00:00:20 keeps 10s of video.",
  "command example": "i input -ss 00:00:10 -to 00:00:20 -c copy output"
}

I need to change the end time with '-to' and assume the start time is 00:00:00.
Output:
{"command": "i input -ss 00:00:00 -to 00:00:42 -c copy output"}
